## Time and room

TR 18:30-19:50, Russ 339

## Textbook

There is no textbook for this course. Instead, we will be using freely available
resources, primarily:

- [MDN "Learn Web Development"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com)

## Required software

Students will need

- A computer with a current Node LTS version installed (Node 12+)
- A text or code editor (VS Code is a good free option)
- A GitHub account
- A git client (the git commandline tool, GitHub Desktop, Tower, etc.)

## Assignments

There will be weekly assignments, due by 11:59pm Sunday evenings. The
assignments will be related to an overall course project.

## Exams

There will be two exams, a midterm and a final.

## Cheating

Cheating on assignments or exams will not be tolerated. What counts as cheating?
At a basic level, cheating is turning in someone else's work as your own.

That doesn't mean you can't do research on the internet or ask other people for
help. Getting help is good! However, turning in work that you didn't do, or that
you don't understand, is not good.

Examples of _acceptable_ use of external code:

- You ask a friend for help with a part of your assignment, and they point out
  mistakes in code you have written or suggest how to implement certain
  features.
- You find a piece of code on Stack Overflow that implements some part of your
  assignment (e.g., sorting an array), and you write code for your assignment
  based on this code.
- You find a piece of code on Stack Overflow that implements some part of your
  assignment (e.g., sorting an array), and you include this code in your
  assignment with comments explaining how the code works and saying where it
  came from.

Examples of _unacceptable_ use of external code:

- You ask a friend for help with your assignment, they give you their code, and
  you turn that in, even if you cite the source.
- You post an assignment on a site like Stack Overflow or Chegg, someone
  answers, and you turn in that answer, even if you cite the source.
- You find useful code on a site like Stack Overflow or Chegg, include that code
  in your assignment, and turn it in with no descriptive comments and/or without
  citing the source.
- You find the answer to an assignment on the internet and turn that in, even if
  you describe how it works and/or cite the source. (At least 50% of the work in
  an assignment must be your own.)

To summarize, legitimately getting help is fine. Getting the answer is not fine.

If you are found to have cheated, you will get an automatic 0 on the exam or
assignment for the first offense, and a failing grade in the course for the
second offense.

## Grading

Assignments will be worth 60% of the overall course grade (6% each). Exams will
be worth 40% (20% each).
