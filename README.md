Welcome to CS 2800! This repository contains information about the class, setup
instructions, and links to useful information.

CS 2800 will introduce students to client-side web development. Topics covered
include HTML document structure and styling, accessibility, JavaScript, React,
and JavaScript unit testing. The course assumes that students have successfully
completed an undergraduate programming course such as CS 1160.

## Instructor

Jason Cheatham (jason.cheatham@wright.edu)

## Time and room

The class meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:30-7:50pm in Russ 339.

Office hours are after class -- Tuesdays and Thursday from 7:50-8:50pm in
Russ 339.

Students may also attend lectures and take exams remotely. Lectures will be
broadcast through Collaborate, and exams will be administered through Pilot.
Remote lecture and exam times are the same as in-class meeting times.

Lecture recordings will be available, although students are highly encouraged to
attend lectures at the time they are given to be able to ask questions. Remote
exams will not require the use of LockDown.

## Textbook

There is no textbook for this course. Instead, we will be using freely available
resources, including:

- [MDN "Learn Web Development"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com)
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

## Required software

Students will need

- A computer with a current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  installed (Node 12+)
- A text or code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a good free
  option)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- A git client (the [git command line tool](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
  [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), etc.)

## Grading

**Assignments**: There will be weekly assignments most weeks.

**Midterm exam**: There will be a midterm exam during week 7 of the course.

**Final exam**: There will be a comprehensive final exam during finals week.

## Academic integrity

Cheating on assignments or exams will not be tolerated. What counts as cheating?
At a basic level, cheating is turning in someone else's work as your own.

That doesn't mean you can't do research on the internet or ask other people for
help. Getting help is good! However, turning in work that you didn't do, or that
you don't understand, is not good.

Examples of _acceptable_ use of external code:

- You ask a friend for help with a part of your assignment, and they point out
  mistakes in code you have written or suggest how to implement certain
  features.
- You find a piece of code on Stack Overflow that implements some part of your
  assignment (e.g., sorting an array), and you write code for your assignment
  based on this code.
- You find a piece of code on Stack Overflow that implements some part of your
  assignment (e.g., sorting an array), and you include this code in your
  assignment with comments explaining how the code works and saying where it
  came from.

Examples of _unacceptable_ use of external code:

- You ask a friend for help with your assignment, they give you their code, and
  you turn that in, even if you cite the source.
- You post an assignment on a site like Stack Overflow or Chegg, someone
  answers, and you turn in that answer, even if you cite the source.
- You find useful code on a site like Stack Overflow or Chegg, include that code
  in your assignment, and turn it in with no descriptive comments and/or without
  citing the source.
- You find the answer to an assignment on the internet and turn that in, even if
  you describe how it works and/or cite the source. (At least 50% of the work in
  an assignment must be your own.)

To summarize, legitimately getting help is fine. Getting the answer is not fine.

If you are found to have cheated, you will get an automatic 0 on the exam or
assignment for the first offense, and a failing grade in the course for the
second offense.
