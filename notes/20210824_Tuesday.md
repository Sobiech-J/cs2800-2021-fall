# Tuesday, August 24

In the first class we went over the syllabus, covered the basics of using Git
and GitHub, and discussed some of the concepts involved in web development.
Unfortunately, my own introduction to Collaborate didn't quite stick with me, so
there's no recording for the first class. Luckily, there isn't a quiz or
assignment due on Thursday, so if you weren't in class you'll be fine.

Things to do/review if you were remote:

- Review the [syllabus](../README.md)
- Get a git client and try it out; GitHub's
  [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)Â is a good
  resource. If you want to try out the standard Git flow, you can fork (like
  making a copy of) the
  [course repository](https://github.com/WSU-jcheatham/cs2800-2021-fall)
- Become familiar with (or at least take a look at)
  [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or another code editor

Again, there's nothing due on Thursday, so don't worry if you missed today. Next
time I'll remember to hit record!
