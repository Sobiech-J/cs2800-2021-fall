In class 2 I gave a high-level overview of
[how the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works).
I also described the assignment process in more detail, provided some additional
information about git, and ran through an example assignment that was
essentially the same as assignment 1.

The git document in the course GitHub repo has been updated with some additional
background and a list of commonly used git commands.
