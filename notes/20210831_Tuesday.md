# Tuesday, August 31

On Tuesday I briefly reviewed how we use Git and GitHub in the course. A key
takeaway is that you don't have to use the git command line tools if you'd
prefer something else. The most important thing for the assignments is just that
you be able to clone a repository, make changes and commit them, and push the
changes back to GitHub. How you do that isn't super important.

I also introduced HTML, discussing the language (declarative, mostly tags
containing content) and the basic structure of a document (nested tags). I
showed the general format of tags: "normal" (`<h1></h1>`) and "self-closing" or
"void" (`<meta>`).

Tags may also have attributes, like `<html lang="en">` (the `lang="en"` bit is
the attribute). Attributes may have string values, and some of them may also be
boolean (true/false). You may see attributes written in different ways:
`<html lang=en>`, `<html lang='en'>`, `<html lang="en">`. All of these will
typically work in a browser, but we will always use the form `<html lang="en">`
(double quoted attribute value) as it is the most common.

I misspoke at one point and said that tags with no content, like
`<h1></h1>`, could also be written as `<h1/>`. This is **not** the case. The `</>`
form of a tag is only valid for the specific tags that are self-closing or void
(i.e., they never contain content), like `<img>`. These tags can be written like
`<img/>`, but the `/` is unnecessary in HTML. Normal tags, like `<h1>` or
`<div>`, must always have a closing tag, so should be written as `<div></div>`
if they are empty.

This is the scratch document we used in class, which just contains a random
sampling of tags:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Hello!</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Hi!</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <h3>Hi!</h3>

    <p>This is a <b>paragraph</b>.</p>
    <p>This is a <strong>paragraph</strong>.</p>
      <button data-id="clickme">Ok</button>      
    <a href="https://google.com">Click me</a>      
    <hr />
    <img src="cookies.jpg" height="400" />
