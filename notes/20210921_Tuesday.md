# Tuesday, September 21

Today we briefly discussed some common issues about assignment 4, and then we
started on JavaScript. The scratch files from this class are [here](https://github.com/WSU-jcheatham/cs2800-playground/tree/20210921_Tuesday/src).

- A brief history of JavaScript
- ECMAScript = JavaScript
- Primitive data types
  - Boolean - true, false
  - Number - floats and ints
  - String - can be in single or double quotes
  - undefined - special "nothing" value; there is also `null`
- Complex data types
  - Arrays - linear list of values, kind of like an ArrayList in Java, but the
    values don't have to be of the same type (`[1, 2, 'a', 'b', [3, 4, 'c']]`)
  - Objects - a key/value store, like a Java HashMap
    (`{ a: 'foo', b: 23, c: [1, 2, 3] }`)
- `typeof`
  - `typeof 5` -> "number"
  - `typeof 'a'` -> "string"
  - `typeof true` -> "boolean"
  - `typeof undefined` -> "undefined"
  - `typeof [2, 3]` -> "object"
  - `typeof {a: 'one', b: 'cat'}` -> "object"
- JS can go in `<script>` tags in an HTML document, or it can go in an external
  `.js` file loaded with a `<script>` tag.
