# Tuesday, October 5 - Midterm review

The test will be on Thursday, October 7. It will be around 30 questions,
multiple choice and short answer. The test will be given over Pilot, so there
will be **no in-person class on Thursday**. You must take the test at some point
between noon and midnight (a 12 hour window). Once you start the test, you will
have one hour to complete it.

Below are some relevant topics that we've covered so far this semester.

## Git and GitHub

A **repository** is a directory containing files that are managed by git.

GitHub is a website where you can store code repositories.

You can use a git client, such as the `git` command line tool or GitHub Desktop,
to download a repository from GitHub onto your computer. This is called
**cloning**.

A Git repository can store multiple sets of code. These are called **branches**.
Generally a repository starts out with a `main` branch. When you've cloned an
existing repository and you want to make changes, such as adding a new feature
to a program, it's common to create a new branch to do your work in.

When you have edited code in a repository on your computer and you want git to
save the changes, you **commit** the changes.

When you have committed changes to your local repository and you want to send
them to GitHub, you **push** the commits.

If you've been doing work in a branch other than `main` and you pushed some
commits, you can open a **pull request** on GitHub. This is a request to add the
changes you made in your branch to the `main` branch in the repository. Whoever
can edit the `main` branch can review your PR, leave comments, and eventually
merge the branch into `main`.

If you've been doing some work in your branch in the repository on your
computer, and someone else makes an update to the repository on GitHub, you may
want to add those changes to your branch. To do that, you first need to get the
updates from GitHub into your local repository (from the command line this is
`git fetch`, in GitHub desktop you do a sync), then you **merge** the changes
from the updated branch (`main` or `origin/main`) into your branch.

## HTML

HTML is a language made up of **tags**. Tags represent **elements**. Most tags
have two parts: the base tag, like `<h1>`, and a closing tag, like `</h1>`. A
tag with content would look like `<h1>Hi!</h1>`. Some tags we've used this
semester include:

- `<html>` - contains an entire HTML document
- `<head>` - contains metadata about a document such as the title
- `<title>` - the title of page, displayed in the browser's title bar
- `<body>` - contains the main visible content of a page
- `<h1>` - a level 1 heading
- `<h2>` - a level 2 (smaller) heading
- `<p>` - a paragraph
- `<ul>` - an unordered list
- `<ol>` - an ordered list
- `<li>` - an item in a list
- `<table>` - a table (like a spreadsheet)
- `<b>` - bold text
- `<strong>` - another way to bold text
- `<div>` - a generic container for other elements
- `<span>` - a generic container for runs of text (you could use it like `<b>`
  to mark some text, but `<span>` doesn't apply any styles on its own)

Some tags don't have corresponding closing tags. The only such tags we've really
looked at this semester have been:

- `<img>` - an image
- `<link>` - goes in the head, used to link external resources, such as CSS
  style files, to a document

Tags may have **attributes**. An attribute has a name and a value, and is
written like `<script src="script.js"></script>`. In that tag, `src` is an
attribute and `script.js` is its value. Attribute values are always strings. An
element may have more than one attribute.

Some tags represent **block** elements, while others represent **inline**
elements. A block element is one, like an `h1` or `p`, that will always take up
the full width available to it. If you put two block elements next to each other
in HTML, like `<p>Paragraph 1</p><p>Paragraph 2</p>`, they'll render on two
separate lines in the browser, because each one will take up the full width of
the page.

An inline element is one like `<img>` or `<b>` that _doesn't_ try to fill the
full width of a page. If you put an `<img>` in a line of text, you'll get an
image with words to the right and left of it -- the image won't be on a line of
its own. Similarly, if you have `one <b>fish</b> two <b>fish</b>`, all of those
words will render on a single line in the browser.

Some tags are part of a set. For example, `<ul>` and `<li>` are meant to be used
together. A `<ul>` is a list, and a `<li>` is a list item. Lists should _only_
contain list items; you should not put random tags in a list. For example,
putting an `<h1>` tag in a `<ul>` _may_ render in a browser, but it is not
valid.

A **document** is a collection of HTML with a specific format. In particular, a
valid HTML document must contain:

1. a `<!DOCTYPE html>` directive at the top of the files
2. an outer `<html>` tag
3. a `<head>` tag in the `<html>` tag
4. a `<body>` tag in the `<html>` tag
5. a `<title>` tag in the `<head>` tag
6. a `lang` attribute on the `<html>` tag that specifies a valid language code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

HTML code can be commented using `<!-- stuff -->`, like:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Hi!</h1>

  <!-- <h2>This is a commented out header</h2> -->
</body>
```

## CSS

CSS is **Cascading Style Sheets**. It language for declaring style rules that
will change the visual presentation of elements.

CSS styles can be specified in 3 places:

1. In a `style` attribute on a tag, like `<h1 style="color: blue">Hi</h1>`
2. In a `<style>` element, like
   ```html
   <html>
     <head>
       <style>
         h1 {
           color: blue;
         }
       </style>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hi!</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```
3. In an external style file linked to the document with a `<link>` tag, like:
   ```css
   /* styles.css */
   h1 {
     color: blue;
   }
   ```
   ```html
   <!-- index.html -->
   <html>
     <head>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Hi!</h1>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

A page may include multiple `<style>` blocks and linked style files.

Code in a CSS in a `<style>` block or a separate CSS file can be commented using
`/* */`.

There are a huge number of CSS properties. Some that we've used this semester
include:

- `color` - sets text/foreground color
- `background` - sets background color
- `margin` - adds spacing around an element
- `padding` - adds spacing inside an element
- `width` - sets an element's width
- `height` - sets an element's height
- `border` - draws a border around an element
- `border-radius` - gives an element rounded corners

Some properties, such as `margin` and `padding`, can be set individually on the
sides of an element using properties like `margin-top` and `padding-left`.

Some properties, such as `border`, can take multiple values. For example
`border` can take 3 values: a style, a thickness, and a color. The rule
`border: solid 1px black` will give an element a solid black border that is 1
pixel thick.

Many CSS properties take dimensional values -- they specify lengths (`width` or
`height`) or thicknesses (`padding`, `border-width`). Any such values **must**
have units or CSS will ignore the value. We've mostly used 2 units this
semester: `px` (pixels) and `em` (basically the font size). A margin of `10px`
will add 10 pixels of space around an element. A padding of `1em` in an element
with a font-size of 20px will add 20px of space around the inside edge of the
element.

CSS rules specified in `<style>` blocks or CSS files are applied to elements
using **selectors**. We've used 3 types of selectors this semester:

1. **type**, like `h2` or `p`
2. **class**, like `.section-heading` or `.rounded`
3. **id**, like `#page-wheading`

A type selector matches elements based on their tag type. A style rule like
`h2 { color: red; }` would match all `<h2>` elements, making their color red.

A class selector matches elements based on their `class` attribute. The `class`
attribute value should contain one or more space-separated strings. Each of
these is a "class". For example,

```html
<h2 class="section-heading rounded">Ingredients</h2>
```

The `<h2>` above has two CSS classes: "section-heading" and "rounded". It could
be matched by CSS rules like:

```css
.section-heading {
  color: green;
}
.rounded {
  background: gray;
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```

Multiple elements in a page may have the same class value or values. It's
perfectly fine to have an `<h2 class="section-heading rounded"></h2>` and
`<div class="rounded"></div>` in a document.

An ID selector matches an `id` attribute. Although many elements may have `id`
attributes, only one element should have any given ID value. If you have
`<h2 id="ingredients"></h2>`, no other element on the page should have
`id="ingredients"`. ID selectors start with a `#`, like:

```css
#ingredients {
  color: blue;
}
```

Since there are multiple types of rules, you may end up with multiple rules
applying to any given element. For example, if you have
`<h2 id="ingredients" class="section-heading"></h2>` along with the rules from
the CSS examples above, you'll end up with several matching selectors rules: one
for `h2`, one for `.section-heading`, and one for `#ingredients`. All of them
specify a different value for `color`. Which `color` value applies? We've talked
about two ways to decide:

1. Specificity - a `style` attribute is more specific than an ID selector, which
   is more specific than a class selector, which is more specific than a type
   selector. If two rules have different specificities, the more specific one
   wins.
2. Order - if multiple rules with the same specificity match an element, the
   _last_ one seen by the browser (which reads them from top to bottom) will
   apply.

When a style is applied to an element, that style also applies to any children
of that element. For example, if you add `style="font-size: 10px"` to the
`<body>` tag, every element in the page will have a base font size of `10px`,
because the `<body>` tag contains all the visible content of a document.

## Accessibility

The goal of accessibility is to make web content accessible to the widest number
of users possible. This means making content available to users who might not be
able to see it, or who might not be able to use the mouse.

Three techniques we discussed for improving accessibility are:

1. Landmark tags. These are tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`
   that can be used to mark the key areas of a document. These tags don't change
   the look of a page, the just help any tools that are processing the page,
   like screen readers, know where content is in the page.
2. `alt` and ARIA label attributes. These allow extra textual content to be
   added to elements for use by screen readers, as with
   `<img src="01234.jpg" alt="A plate of cookies">`.
3. Ensuring sufficient contrast. Low contrast content (where the text and the
   background are close to the same color) can be hard for many people to read.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language much like Java or C. You can create
variables, make comparisons, execute instructions, and print output to the
browser's console.

### Where it goes

Like CSS, JS can either go in a document directly or in an external file. A
document may include multiple scripts.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      console.log('Scripty!');
    <script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```

### Data types

Unlike C or Java, variables in JavaScript are not typed. You declare them with
`let` or `const` and a name, but no type, like:

```js
const someValue = 10;
let someOtherValue = 'foo';
let aThirdValue;
```

You may see legacy code declaring variables with `var`, but you should never do
this.

While _variables_ don't have types, _values_ in JavaScript do have types. The
main types are:

- number - 0, 1, 10, 45.3 -20
- string - a string of characters, like "hello there" or 'one fish two fish'
- boolean - true or false
- undefined - the value of a variable that hasn't been initialized
- array - contains a linear list of items
- object - contains property names and associated values
- null - like `undefined`, but it's meant to represent an _intentionally_ empty
  value as opposed to one that simply hasn't been initialized yet

JS only has one type of number. There aren't separate integer and floating point
types. JS also has values for `Infinity` and `NaN`.

JS strings are a lot like C++ or Java strings. You can get their length with
`.length`, and concatenate them with `+`. There is no difference between a
string that uses double quotes (`"Hi"`) and a string that uses single quotes
(`'Hi'`). There is a third type of string, called a **template string**, that
can be written using back ticks, like `` `this is a template string` ``.
Template strings behave differently than regular strings in a couple of ways,
but the most useful to us right now is that you can include variables directly
in them, like:

```js
let someValue = 22;
console.log(`The value of someValue is ${someValue}`);
// will print out "The value of someValue is 22"
```

Arrays are written using square brackets, and elements within arrays can be
accessed with square brackets.

```js
let myArr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3];
console.log(myArr[2]);
// prints "c"
myArr[2] = 45;
// value of myArr is now ['a', 'b', 45, 1, 2, 3]
```

Arrays indexes must be non-negative integers. Accessing an invalid index will
not generate an error, it will just return `undefined`.

```js
let myArr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(myArr[10]);
// prints "undefined"
```

An array can contain any type of value, including other arrays, and different
elements can be of different types.

Objects are collections of property names and associated values. Property names
are always strings, but values can be of any type. You would typically access
object values with a dot (`obj.propertyName`), but you can also use square
brackets if necessary, such as when a property name is stored in a variable.

```js
let myObj = { firstName: 'Bob', lastName: 'Smith', age: 23 };
console.log(myObj.firstName);
// prints "Bob"
console.log(`${myObj.firstName} ${myObj.lastName} is ${age} years old`);
// prints "Bob Smith is 23 years old"
myObj.middleName = 'Sam';
// value of myObj is now { firstName: 'Bob', middleName: 'Sam', lastName: 'Smith', age 23 }
let key = 'middleName';
console.log(myObj[key]);
// prints "Sam"
```

As with an array, accessing a property name that doesn't exist will simply
return `undefined`. Also like an array, the value associated with an object
property can have any type, and can even be an array or an object.

When accessing nested values, such as values in arrays that are in other arrays
or in objects, or properties on objects in arrays, consider each step of what
you need to do.


```js
const bio = {
  name: 'Bob
  age: 23,
  vehicles: [
    { name: 'Honda Fit', year: 2017 },
    { name: 'Mazda Miata', year: 2015 }[
  ]
};
```

To access the name of the second vehicle, you'd say `bio.vehicles[1].name`.
You could break this down as

```js
let vehicles = bio.vehicles;
let firstVehicle = vehicles[1];
let name = firstVehicle.name;
```

Arrays and objects are passed around by reference. That means that if you assign
the same object to multiple variables and change the object in one variable, the
change is reflected in all of them.

```js
let orig = [1, 20, 12];
let other = orig;
other[1] = 0;
console.log(orig);
// prints "[0, 20, 12]"
```

### Operators

Java has a fairly standard set of mathematical and boolean operators:

- `+, -, /, *, %` - arithmetic operations on numbers
- `+` - concatenates strings
- `++, --` - unary increment and decrement
- `+=, -=, /=, *=, %=` - operator + assignment combination; `a += 4` is the same
  as `a = a + 4`
- `==` - equality comparison with type coercion (`'1' == 1` is true)
- `===` - strict equality comparison, no type coercion (`'1' === 1` is false)
- `<, >, <=, >=` - relational comparisons
- `? :` - ternary operator (discussed below)
- `typeof` - operator that returns the name of the type of a value

`typeof` will return the type name of a primitive value, or "object" for
everything else.

```js
typeof 1                 // "number"
typeof 'abc'             // "string"
typeof undefined         // "undefined"
typeof true              // "boolean"
typeof [1, 2, 3]         // "object"
typeof { a: 1, b: 23 }   // "object"
```

### Conditionals

JS has two main conditional constructs: the `if` statement and the ternary
expression.

An `if` statement takes a condition and executes a code block if the condition
is truthy. It doesn't execute the block if the condition is falsey.

```js
let a = 5;
if (a < 10) {
  console.log('is less');
}
// prints "is less"
```

JS conditions may be "truthy" or "falsey", not just `true` or `false`. A
"falsey" value is 0, null, undefined, or an empty string. Anything else is
"truthy".

`if` statements may have `else if` and `else` clauses. An `else if` clause
specifies a secondary condition to try if the original condition is falsey. An
`if` statement may have any number of `else if` clauses.

An `else` clause is run if no previous `if` or `else if` condition was truthy.

```js
let a = 5;
if (a < 2) {
  console.log('less than 2');
} else if (a < 3) {
  console.log('less than 3');
} else {
  console.log('greater than or equal to 3');
}
// Prints "greater than or equal to 3"
```

A ternary expression, `A ? B : C`, is kind of like an `if` statement except that
it returns a value rather than executing a block of instructions. The condition
`A` is evaluated; if it's truthy, the value of the overall expression is `B`,
otherwise the value of the expression is `C`.

```js
let a = 5;
let message = a < 4 ? 'less than 4' : 'greater than or equal to 4';
console.log(message);
// prints 'greater than or equal to 4'
```

### Loops

JS has several kinds of loop.

`for`, used for incrementing or decrementing a loop control variable.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

`for-of`, for iterating through arrays.

```js
const arr = ['one', 'fish', 'two', 'fish'];
for (const item of arr) {
  console.log(item);
}
// will print each item contained in `arr`, one per line
```

`for-in`, for iterating through object properties.

```js
const obj = { firstName: 'Bob', lastName: 'Smith', age: 23 };
for (const property in obj) {
  console.log(`${property}: ${obj[property]}`);
}
```

`while`, for looping indefinitely

```js
// Loop until you get a random number that's less than or equal to 0.1
while (Math.random() > 0.1) {
  console.log('Looping...');
}
```

`do-while`, for looping indefinitely, and is guaranteed to always run at least
once (a while loop might never run if it's condition is false to start with).

```js
// Loop until you get a random number that's less than or equal to 0.1
do {
  console.log('Looping...');
} while (Math.random() > 0.1);
```

### Functions

A function is a named block of code that can be executed on-demand by writing
its name followed by parentheses. Functions can take arguments and can return a
single value (although they don't have to return anything).

Functions can be created using **function declarations** or **function
expressions**.

```js
// declaration
function myFunc1(arg1, arg2) {
  console.log(arg1, arg2);
}

// expression
const myFunc2 = function (arg1, arg2) {
  console.log(arg1, arg2);
}

// arrow expression
const myFunc3 = (arg1, arg2) => {
  console.log(arg1, arg2);
}
```

For our purposes, these are all basically the same. In all three cases, you end
up with a function that can be called with 2 arguments and that will print out
both arguments to the console.

Functions can take zero or more arguments. A function argument is a lot like a
local variable: it has a name that you come up with, and it will have a value
provided by whoever called the function.

```js
function doStuff(arg1, arg2) {
  console.log(arg1, arg2);
}

doStuff([1, 2, 4], 'my name is bob');
// prints "[1, 2, 4] my name is bob"
```

Functions _can_ be called with more arguments than they declare, or with fewer.
If a function is called with fewer arguments than it expects, any unfilled
arguments are undefined. If a function is called with more arguments than it
expects, any arguments past those it uses are ignored.

```js
fuction doStuff(arg1, arg2) {
  console.log(arg1, arg2);
}

doStuff('Bob');
// prints "Bob undefined"
```

A JS function can inspect the arguments it was passed, such as with the `typeof`
operator, and take different actions based on the type. For example, a function
might print one message if called with a string, and a different message if
called with a number.

### Modules

A script included with a tag like `<script src="script.js"></script>` is loaded
and executed just as if it were directly in the document rather than an external
file. Any variables created in the script file will be available to any code
that runs after it.

Script modules provide more encapsulation, limiting what values are visible
outside of a script. They also allow a script to directly load other scripts
without having to use a separate `<script>` tag. When you declare functions or
variables within a module, they are only visible within that module unless
specifically "exported".

To be a module, a script has to be loaded by a script tag with a `type`
attribute of `"module"`, like `<script type="module" src="script.js"></script>`.
An inline script (one where the code is between the `<script></script>` tags
rather than loaded from an external file) can also be a module.

A script will also be treated as a module if it's imported from a module script.
Module scripts can use the **import** keyword to load other script files.
`import` can also be used to get specific functions or values that some other
script has **exported**. For example:

```js
// script1.js
export function printVal(val) {
  console.log(val);
}
```

```js
// script2.js
import { printVal } from './script1.js';
printVal(23);
```

### Array methods

Arrays have a number of useful methods. We talked about some of them in class,
including:

`forEach` takes a function as an argument and calls that function once for each
item in the array, passing the item to the function.

```js
[1, 2, 4].forEach((val) => { console.log(val); });
// prints "1", "2", and "4", one number per line
```

`filter` takes a function as an argument and calls that function once for each
item in the array, passing the item to the function. Returns a new array
containing only the items that the function argument returned true for. **Does
not modify** the original array.

```js
const small = [1, 10, 7, 15].filter((val) => { return val < 10; });
console.log(small);
// prints "[1, 7]"
```

`map` takes a function as an argument and calls that function once for each
item in the array, passing the item to the function. Returns a new array
containing the return values from the function argument.

```js
const larger = [1, 10, 7, 15].map((val) => { return val + 5 });
console.log(larger);
// prints "[6, 15, 12, 20]"
```

`pop` removes the last item from an array, returning the item.

```js
let myArr = [1, 2, 3];
let lastVal = myArr.pop();
console.log(lastVal);
// prints "3"
console.log(myArr);
// prints "[1, 2]"
```

`slice` returns a subset of an array. If called with 2 arguments, the first
argument is a start index and the last argument is an end index; the slice runs
from start to end - 1. If called with 1 argument, the argument is a start index
and the slice runs from start to the end of the array. If called with no
arguments, the slice is a **copy** of the whole array.

```js
let myArr = [1, 10, 7, 15];
console.log(myArr.slice(0, 2));
// prints "[1, 10]"
console.log(myArr.slice(2));
// prints "[7, 15]"
let newArr = myArr.slice();
console.log(newArr);
// prints "[1, 10, 7, 15]"
newArr[0] = 23;
console.log(myArr);
// prints "[1, 10, 7, 15]" -- myArr has its original value since newArr was a
// copy
```
